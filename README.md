# Project Three: Roller Derby Wheel Selector

# Getting Started with the Wheel Selector App

This App was designed for Roller Derby players - when travelling for games, the wheels on your skates and the surface you are skating on will determine your effectiveness on the track! 

## What is Durometer tho?
Durometer or Shore durometer is a standardized way to measure the hardness of materials like rubber and plastics. Durometer measurement scales range from 0 to 100+ but technically durometer is a dimensionless measurement. 

You must match the hardness of the wheels to the level of grip of your floor. If your floor is slippery you will need grippy soft wheels. If your floor is sticky you will need hard slippery wheels. 

The lower the durometer the softer the wheels (78A wheels are softer than 98A wheels).
